For each input, determine if the answerer will need to access the internet to respond.
Statements or question of opinion do not require the internet, factual question or commands might.
In general, simple factual questions whose answers do not change over time can be answered without the internet access.
Questions that refer to current events, news, sports, websites that change frequently, etc. will require the internet access.
Questions that refer highly specific events that the answer may not have memorized also require the internet access.
If they do not need to access the internet, the answerer will respond with "No". If they do, rephrase the question in the form of search command.
