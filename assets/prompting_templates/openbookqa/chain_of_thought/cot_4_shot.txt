Answer the question

Question: The sun is responsible for
Possible answers: A. puppies learning new tricks, B. children growing up and getting old, C. flowers wilting in a vase, D. plants sprouting, blooming and wilting
Let's think step by step:
- puppies can learn new tricks even in the dark or inside a house
- children growing up and getting old is a natural cycle of life
- flowers wilting in a vase could result from not suppyling enough water
- sunlight is essential for plants for photosynthesis which make them grow, sprout, bloom and wilt when there's not enough of it
So the final answer is: D. plants sprouting, blooming and wilting

Question: A magnet will stick to
Possible answers: A. a belt buckle, B. a wooden table, C. a plastic cup, D. a paper plate
Let's think step by step:
- a magnet will attract magnetic metals through magnetism
- a belt buckle is usually made out of metal such as nickel, zinc or copper alloys which are magnetic
- wood, plastic or paper are materials that do not contain metal and thus are not magnetic
So the final answer is: A. a belt buckle

Question: Which would be a logical hypothesis after viewing a white substance on the floor, with a yellow carton on the counter?
Possible answers: A. milk was spilled, B. white juice was spilled, C. bleach was spilled, D. was an illusion
Let's think step by step:
- hypothesis means scientific guess about the cause and effect of an event
- the yellow carton on the counter was most likely found in the kitchen
- milk is a white liquid which is usually stored in carton boxes
- white juice is not very specific
- bleach is a white liquid but it's unlikely to be found on a counter
- let's not consider the possiblity of being mistaken about seeing the white substance on the floor and it being just an illusion
So the final answer is: A. milk was spilled

Question: A heavier object
Possible answers: A. requires less force to move, B. requires minimal effort to move, C. requires more muscle power to shift, D. requires a light touch to move
Let's think step by step:
- classical mechanics deals with the motion of bodies under the influence of forces or with the equilibrium of bodies when all forces are balanced
- Newton's second law is F=ma, where F is the force applied to the body, m is mass and a is acceleration
- consider a body with mass m1 and a heavier body of mass m2 = m1+1, the force required to move the heavier body needs to be greater according to the Newton's second law
- force, effort, muscle power, touch in possible answers are the same words for making the object move
So the final answer is: C. requires more muscle power to shift
